#   # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
#   # For images you might use something like this:
#   # def extension_white_list
#   #   %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
#   # end
#
#   # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
#   # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
